### Abstract

The semiconductor industry is witnessing a nascent
security paradigm shift in the rise of Confidential Computing.
Driven by the need to protect computations delegated to co-
tenanted machines operated by Cloud Computing services, main-
stream instruction set architectures are gradually introducing
novel features that can be used to establish protected isolates
offering strong integrity and confidentiality guarantees to code
and data contained within. Coupled with a Remote Attestation
protocol, a third-party may request the launch of an isolate on
an otherwise untrusted machine and know—with a high degree
of assurance—that a payload of code and data was indeed loaded
into a legitimate isolate with a particular configuration.

We argue that this ability to reliably establish a safe “beach-
head” on an untrusted third-party’s machine has far-reaching
consequences with applications beyond protecting workloads
delegated to Cloud Computing services. In a future world where
facilities for Confidential Computing are widely deployed and
used, we imagine a utopia where inadvertent data leakage is
a curiosity of a bygone age, with encrypted data moving from
isolate to isolate and never resting in plaintext. Moreover, data
is only released in explicitly delimited ways for processing, with
systems and individuals exhibiting fine-grained control over data.

We report on recent activities within Arm in attempting to
realize this vision, and hope that this paper acts as a “call to
arms” to others to join with us in fully exploring the potential
of these emerging technologies.
