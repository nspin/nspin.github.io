Source of my personal website, [nickspinale.com](https://nickspinale.com).

It is built using a sophisticated, feature-rich static site generator you may have heard of called `site.py`, which uses pandoc and jinja2, watches files for changes, serves the site, and more.

The design of this site is inspired by the minimalistic style of the [website](https://jaspervdj.be) of Jasper Van der Jeugt, the creator of Hakyll.
