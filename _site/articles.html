            An Elegant Method for Solving the Rubik's Cube

    <p>I present a new method based on the idea of reducing the cube to
states which can be solved with increasingly limited sets of turns. This
method has the interesting property of ending with intuitive
blockbuilding.</p>

    <p>All that’s necessary for solving the cube blindfolded is a solid
understanding of the basic properties of the cube and some practice.
This article provides an in-depth explanation of one common strategy for
solving the cube blindfolded. It doesn’t assume any knowledge of cube
theory, but the reader will find some undergraduate math (e.g. basic
group theory) useful.</p>

    <p>X11 programming in Haskell has traditionally been done using the <a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/X11-1.6.1.2">X11 package</a>.
Many of these bindings were written by hand and, due to their reliance
on FFI, are susceptible to some threading issues. <a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xhb">xhb</a>, a newer package,
provides low-level bindings to X11 based on the same XML as <a
href="https://xcb.freedesktop.org/">xcb</a>. I present a new set of
libraries which serve as layers of abstraction over the low-level xhb
bindings. These libraries encapsulate interaction with the X server in a
monad transformer, enabling the expression of pure X logic.</p>
