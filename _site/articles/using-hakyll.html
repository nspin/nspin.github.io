<p>A static website is basically a bunch of files meant to be served by directory. You could think if it as a pure mapping from filepaths to files, where most filepaths map to a default 404 page. Pages can’t be generated on the fly, but there is one serious benefit to a static website: they’re really really easy to mantain and host. There are a lot of companies that will serve a static directory for you, and getting this set up is super easy because you don’t have to worry about <em>any</em> server logic. Github, for example, will serve your static site from a repository called <em>username</em>.github.io for free under the domain of the same name. That’s how this site is hosted.</p>

<p>What’s more, there are a bunch of tools for ‘compiling’ directories of static files from other files. Some names you might have heard of are Jekyll, Middleman, and Octopress. I chose to use on called <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>. Hakyll isn’t actually an executable or a script. It’s just a library consisting of a EDLS for describing transformations of static files. So, this website consists of a bunch of html, css, and markdown files and templates, and a Haskell program that describes the process these files go through to become the static files being served to you now. Its source can be found here: <a href="http://github.com/nickspinale/website">github.com/nickspinale/website</a>.</p>
<p>Hakyll is a really great approach to the static website problem, remeniscent of how projects such as xmonad and yi approach configuration. Learn more about it <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">here</a>, or check out its source <a href="http://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll">here</a>.</p>
